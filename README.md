<h2>Discalimer</h2>

This project was created as an assignment for the Frontend Development Training Course organized by Kreativestorm.
It represents 1 of 2 main assignments of the 4th week, out of the 4 weeks of this course, along side https://github.com/AlexGTraining/fdc_calculator.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Assignment specifications</h3>

  - Develop a basic jumping game, similar to the T-Rex game in Google Chrome
  - Create functions to handle character movement (e.g., jumping), obstacle generation, collision detection
  - Character Movement
    - Allow the player to control the character's movement using keyboard input (e.g., spacebar for jumping).
    - Implement gravity to simulate realistic jumping behavior for the character
  - Obstacle Generation
    - Generate obstacles (e.g., cacti) at regular intervals
    - Ensure obstacles move towards the character at a consistent pace to create a sense of challenge.
  - Collision Detection:
    - Detect collisions between the character and obstacles to determine when the game ends.
    - End the game and display the final score when a collision occurs.
  - Optional
    - scoring system
    - sound effects, background music
    - obstacles with varying widths / heights  
  - Work with assigned colleagues as a team
